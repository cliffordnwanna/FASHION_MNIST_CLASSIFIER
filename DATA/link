The `fashion_mnist.npz` dataset can be downloaded directly using the `tensorflow.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist` module. However, if you specifically need the `.npz` file to use or save locally, you can download it manually or save it after loading it using TensorFlow.

Here's how you can download and save the **Fashion MNIST** dataset as a `.npz` file:

### **Method 1: Using TensorFlow to Download and Save Locally**

If you want to load the dataset using TensorFlow and then save it as `.npz` file:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist

# Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

# Save the data as a .npz file
np.savez_compressed("fashion_mnist.npz", 
                    X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train, 
                    X_test=X_test, y_test=y_test)

print("Fashion MNIST dataset saved as fashion_mnist.npz")
```

**Explanation:**
- The `np.savez_compressed` function saves the arrays in a compressed `.npz` file.
- This script will save the `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test` arrays into a single `.npz` file named `fashion_mnist.npz` in your working directory.

### **Method 2: Downloading Directly from GitHub**

You can manually download the `.npz` file from online repositories that provide it. For example:
- **Fashion MNIST GitHub Repository**: [Fashion MNIST GitHub](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
- **Kaggle Datasets**: [Fashion MNIST on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

You can place the downloaded file in your project's `data/` directory or wherever you need it.

### **Method 3: Using TensorFlow Datasets to Automatically Download**

If you’re using TensorFlow, you can load and directly use the dataset, which will automatically download it if it’s not present:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist

# This will automatically download the Fashion MNIST dataset if it's not already present
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

# Check shapes to verify
print(X_train.shape, y_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_test.shape)
```

### **Method 4: Download Using a Direct URL**

If you need to download the `.npz` file from a direct URL, you can use the `wget` or `curl` command or a Python script:

```bash
# Using wget
wget https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/raw/master/data/fashion/fashion-mnist.npz
```

**Python script:**
```python
import requests

url = "https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/raw/master/data/fashion/fashion-mnist.npz"
response = requests.get(url)

# Save the file to your local directory
with open("fashion_mnist.npz", "wb") as file:
    file.write(response.content)

print("Fashion MNIST dataset downloaded as fashion_mnist.npz")
```

These methods should allow you to easily download and save the Fashion MNIST dataset for use in your projects. If you're planning to use it with TensorFlow, the simplest way is to use the `keras.datasets.fashion_mnist` function.
